- [ ] Check if they have updated the tau anti-electron / anti-muon discriminators and add them to our nuples if they have - may requite an email to the relevant person since the tag POG twiki may not be up to date

- [ ] Check with Janek the status of the 2017 embedding production - Process any complated embedded samples - will require some changes to the python config (see how this was done for 2016)

- [ ] Check with tau trigger contacts (Thomas Strebbler and/or tyler) if any special monitoring triggers are required to measure the SFs of the muon/electron lefs of the lepton+tau cross trigger. If there are required then add to nuples

- [ ] Check if any additional MC samples have been added for latest MC production (some di-boson samples + others were still using an older production and W jets was complatly missing)
